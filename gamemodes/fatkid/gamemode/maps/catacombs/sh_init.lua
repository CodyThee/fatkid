FATKID_BACKSTORY = [[
<h2>Welcome to the Underground, how was the fall.</h2>
<p>
Gregory and the skinnies after school like to play tag, usually ending up with Gregory
being it for the whole game since he's so fat. But one day... they were playing around
Mt. Ebott, where a mysterious and seeminly abandoned mining hole was left, but the Fat
Kid fell in! The skinny kids tried to help him out by creating a human rope, but they
all fell in too. Gregory got so mad, he went on yet another rampage through these catacombs.
